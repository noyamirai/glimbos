## Concept

With Glimbos you can create your own beat by interacting with a bunch of quirky little charaacters that all have their unqiue sounds.
There is no endgoal, no challenge and no tasks, with Glimbos its all about relaxing and enjoying life and its creations, you are here to create something beautiful and are presented with the tools to do so.
