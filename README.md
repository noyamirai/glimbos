## Concept

With Glimbos you can create your own beat by interacting with a bunch of quirky little charaacters that all have their unqiue sounds.
There is no endgoal, no challenge and no tasks, with Glimbos its all about relaxing and enjoying life and its creations, you are here to create something beautiful and are presented with the tools to do so.

## Debriefing

## Work process

On Teusday we discussed what we were going to do and what we wanted to make, we decided to all make a creature that is going to sing when clicked on and a beat is added. When everyone was done with designing a creature we made a design for the website we were going to make. In the sketches you can see what it was going to look like. During designing and coding the design changed a little. Here you can see some images of the design process:
